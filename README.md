Symplectic Repo Tools

NB This isn't packaged in any nice way. It's a bit of a geeky tool to help geeky people do geeky things. Soz.

* Provides a script to generate the xslt config file based on current repostory config 
* Provides a script to process records from an Elements server into EPrints XML
* Can be configured to use a newer version of the xwalks toolkit to test before deployment
* See also: https://github.com/eprintsug/crosswalks_sgul
* Postings on the Symplectic support site
